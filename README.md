# Babayin.SR

## Description

This project was developed for users with an interest in the baybayin script. It is best learned by daily review through spaced repition review. 

Here is the a [link](http://paulmorrow.ca/bayeng1.html) I have been using for reference that dives deeper into the subject

This is a personal passion project of mine and has been built with HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript. It is the first webapp I have built from scratch. I plan to iterate and improve on it as my skill improves.

### Future development

Some improves I want to added in the future.

- Refactored with a JS framework
- Accounts and leaderboards to further gameify the app
- AI implementation of script & voice recognition. The goal is to remove latin script so that all letters are associated with the sounds and writings directly.
- Development into a android & IOS app.
- Blockchain or some sort of Coin which could be used to generate value for those who use the app and improve their skills.
- And more...
